1. Drum Kit -> https://so647.github.io/Drum-Kit/drum-kit<br>
This is my first complete practical JavaScript project

2. Clock -> https://so647.github.io/Clock/clock.html<br>

3. Rock Paper Scissors Game -> https://so647.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/rock-paper-scissors.html<br>
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game was not entirely new to me, as I had previously created a basic version using JavaScript. However, adding the user interface and enhancing the overall design proved to be an enjoyable learning experience.

4. Calculator -> https://so647.github.io/Calculator/calculator.html<br>
I developed a calculator project that provides a user-friendly interface. It performs basic arithmetic operations, handles decimals, and includes input limits, rounding, and error handling.
