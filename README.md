1. Drum Kit -> https://so647.github.io/Drum-Kit/drum-kit      (following: https://javascript30.com/)
This was my first complete practical JavaScript project. I followed a video tutorial, which made the process interesting and enjoyable. I am excited to see my progress in future projects.

3. Clock -> https://so647.github.io/Clock/clock.html
The clock project provided an opportunity to enhance my CSS design skills by experimenting with gradients and creating an aesthetically pleasing layout. I implemented the JavaScript component to dynamically update the clock hands based on the current time. The clock demonstrates both functional and aesthetic aspects, making it an enjoyable project to work on

5. Rock Paper Scissors Game -> https://so647.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/rock-paper-scissors.html
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game was not entirely new to me, as I had previously created a basic version using JavaScript. However, adding the user interface and enhancing the overall design proved to be an enjoyable learning experience.

7. Calculator -> https://so647.github.io/Calculator/calculator.html
I developed a calculator project that provides a user-friendly interface. It performs basic arithmetic operations, handles decimals, and includes input limits, rounding, and error handling.  Calculators have numerous intricacies, such as preventing consecutive operators and handling double negatives as positives. Addressing these subtleties required careful consideration and thorough testing of various scenarios to detect and fix potential errors.
